[Image Captioning](https://github.com/ahkhalwai/Udacity_Nanodegree/tree/master/Computer%20Vision/Image%20Captioning) In this project, In this project, I need to create a neural network architecture to automatically generate captions from images.

After using the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset to train your network, you will test your network on novel images!
