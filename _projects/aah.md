[Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model on AWS](https://github.com/ahkhalwai/Udacity_Nanodegree/tree/master/Deep%20Learning/Sagemaker/Project) In this project I need to construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, I deploy the model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.
