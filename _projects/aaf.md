[Generate TV Scripts](https://github.com/ahkhalwai/Udacity_Nanodegree/tree/master/Deep%20Learning/project-tv-script-generation/project-tv-script-generation) In this project, I'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I am using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network which i build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.
