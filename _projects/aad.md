[Predicting Bike-Sharing Data (Your First Neural Network)](https://github.com/ahkhalwai/Udacity_Nanodegree/tree/master/Deep%20Learning/first_neural_network-267930) In this project, I get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, I have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch. I solved real prediction problems!
