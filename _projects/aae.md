[Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/ahkhalwai/Udacity_Nanodegree/tree/master/Deep%20Learning/project-dog-classification/project-dog-classification) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the AI Nanodegree! In this project, I learn how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
