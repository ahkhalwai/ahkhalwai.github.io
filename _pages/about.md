I am an Engineering Graduate by formal education and an Intel or Facebook AI Scholar. I am a certified professional in computer vision, deep learning, machine learning, and full-stack web development with two years of experience in project work and research papers. I am globally recognized, having been selected among the top 300 in Computer Vision and the top 500 in Deep Learning Nanodegree Scholarships, which led to opportunities in research, open-source contributions, and public speaking on AI topics. I was also involved in two startup ventures and international AI groups.

Research Interests
======

My research interests primarily focus on computer vision and deep learning, leveraging the advanced knowledge gained from my Nanodegree studies. I am particularly fascinated by machine learning, as it models the most advanced agents in our worldâ€”those created by humans through artificial intelligence and those developed through natural processes. I am dedicated to exploring the intersection of these fields to drive innovation and understanding.
