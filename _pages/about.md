I am an Electronics & Telecommunication Engineer by Formal Education, and a Intel or Facebook AI Scholar. I recently completed my [Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://github.com/ahkhalwai/ahkhalwai.github.io/blob/master/images/CVND.pdf) and [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://github.com/ahkhalwai/ahkhalwai.github.io/blob/master/images/DLND.pdf) at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) . Before that, I completed my B.E in Electronics and  Telecommunication Engineering from [PCE, Mumbai](https://www.pce.ac.in/).

Research Interests
======

My research interests use more knowledge on Computer Vision & Deep Learning Nanodegree; I also like to think about Machine Learning as these model the most supreme agents we live with; the former created by Humans while the later created by Biological Science!
